Description: Allows for a quick and flexible specification of Bayesian Neural Networks. 
    These networks can be specified as easiliy as writing Chain(DenseBNN(1, 10, "sigmoid"), DenseBNN(10, 1))
    and are then transformed to Turing models. Turing is like Stan but completely implemented in Julia. The 
    models are then estimated using the NUTS sampler and bayesplot can be used to investigate the chains.
